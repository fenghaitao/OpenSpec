## MODIFIED Requirements
### Requirement: Slash Command Updates
The update command SHALL refresh existing slash command files for configured tools without creating new ones, and ensure the OpenCode archive command accepts change ID arguments.

#### Scenario: Updating slash commands for Antigravity
- **WHEN** `.agent/workflows/` contains `openspec-proposal.md`, `openspec-apply.md`, and `openspec-archive.md`
- **THEN** refresh the OpenSpec-managed portion of each file so the workflow copy matches other tools while preserving the existing single-field `description` frontmatter
- **AND** skip creating any missing workflow files during update, mirroring the behavior for Windsurf and other IDEs
